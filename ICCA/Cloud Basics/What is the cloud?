On-Premises Information System Architecture = Cloud Architecture

	Workload (More emphasize in Cloud)
	Services (More emphasize in Cloud)
	Virtual Machine (More emphasize in Cloud)
	Management Plane (Only in Cloud)
	Virtualization: Platform, Maintenance and Licensing
	Physical Infrastructure: Power, Network, Storage and Racks
	Physical Facility: Costs of Space, Physical Security and Personnel

Types of Cloud Services
	Workload: SaaS. (Easier administration)
	Services: PaaS
	Virtual Machine: IaaS. (Easier control)

Accessing Cloud Services
	The most important thing that we would be connect to the cloud is the use of internet.
	We can use two different ways to connect: Tunneling (VPN) or Endpoint
	Security is provided by vendor, using 3 security components CIA

Why I love the Cloud
	The best providers in the world AWS Azure y GCP
	
	Provision VM
	GCP: Computer Engine -> VM instances -> Create instance
	AWS: EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) -> Launch Instances
	Azure: Create a Resource -> Compute -> Ubuntu -> Create new Reource group & Use pswd (adm account)
