#Regional Computing
-Regional Computing refers to the strategic deployment of cloud provider infrastructure in specific geographic locations to enhance connectivity, reduce latency, and optimize performance for users in that region. 
-These regional data centers ensure faster response times and compliance with local regulations.

#Cloud Scalability
-Cloud Scalability refers to the ability of cloud environments to dynamically adjust resources based on demand. 
-In AWS, services like AWS Lambda enable automatic scaling by provisioning different virtual machines (VMs) or compute resources depending on the number of users interacting with the application simultaneously. 
-This ensures optimal performance and cost efficiency.

#Cloud Availability
-Cloud availability refers to the ability of a cloud environment to remain accessible and operational for authorized users.
-Using a load balancer improves redundancy by distributing traffic across multiple servers, reducing the risk of downtime.
-Redundancy allows the creation of multiple virtual machines (VMs) in different geographic regions, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

#Demo: Cloud Scale
-Scale out
-Manual scale: Instance count 30 
-Custom autoscale: 
  Instance limist 1 (min) - 30 (max)  
  Add a Rule:
    Metric name: CPU percentage
    CPU Percentage: 5%
    Operator: More than 70
    Duration: 5 minutes
    Increase count by 1

    Metric name: CPU percentage
    CPU Percentage: 5.17%
    Operator: Less than 30
    Duration: 5 minutes
    Decrease count by 1
