1. This tells search engines what to and what not to avoid. 
    To find basic information about the web site you have to soy the path */robots.txt or */sitemaps.xml

2.  What website is running on the target, and what is its version? 
    To get version information, we have to use the tool "whatweb url"

3. Directory browsing might reveal where files are stored.
    gobuster dir -u target.ine.local -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
    gobuster dir -u target.ine.local/wp-content -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

4. An overlooked backup file in the webroot can be problematic if it reveals sensitive configuration details.
    gobuster dir -u target.ine.local -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
    gobuster dir -u target.ine.local -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x .bak

    curl -O target.ine.local/wp-config.bak

5. Certain files may reveal something interesting when mirrored. 
    httrack target.ine.local
    cat file-name.php | grep "Flag"
