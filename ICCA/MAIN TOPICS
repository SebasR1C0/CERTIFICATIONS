- Benefits and key characteristics (scalability, elasticity, self-service, etc.).
- Types of clouds: public, private, hybrid.

**Cloud Service Models:**
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Practical examples such as EC2 (AWS), Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine.
- PaaS (Platform as a Service): Examples like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, Google App Engine.
- SaaS (Software as a Service): Examples like Office 365, Gmail, Salesforce.

**Cloud Deployment Models:**
- Differences between public, private, and hybrid clouds.
- Implementation of solutions based on these models.

### Resources to study:
- Introductory cloud courses: Udemy, Coursera, or LinkedIn Learning offer courses like "Cloud Computing Basics" or "Introduction to Cloud Services".
- Books: "Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology & Architecture" by Thomas Erl.

## 2. Cloud Services (Minimum 75%)
This domain focuses on the services offered on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud).

### Recommended materials to study:
**Compute Services:**
- Amazon EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine: Provisioning and managing compute instances.

**Storage Services:**
- Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage: Differences between block, object, and file storage.

**Networking Services:**
- Amazon VPC, Azure Virtual Network, Google VPC: Configuration of virtual private networks, subnets, and managing traffic between instances.

**Database Services:**

### Resources to study:
- Official documentation of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud: Study the services these providers offer and how they are implemented in practice.
- Hands-on labs: Use the free tiers of each provider to experiment with creating compute instances, storage, and networks.
- Courses: Platforms like A Cloud Guru or Linux Academy have detailed modules on each of these services.

## 3. Cloud Security & Regulatory Compliance (Minimum 65%)
This domain covers cloud security and regulatory compliance.

### Recommended materials to study:
**Cloud Security:**
- Data encryption at rest and in transit: Use of TLS/SSL, database encryption, storage encryption (S3, Blob Storage, Cloud Storage).
- Authentication and authorization: Use of MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) and IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

**Shared Responsibility Model:**
- Understanding who is responsible for what in the cloud: The provider is responsible for the infrastructure, the customer is responsible for data and applications.

**Compliance Policies and Tools:**
- Tools like AWS Artifact, Azure Compliance Manager, and Google Cloud Compliance help ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA.

**Security Monitoring and Auditing:**
- Use AWS CloudTrail, Azure Security Center, Google Cloud Security Command Center to detect suspicious activities.

**Compliance Regulations and Standards:**
- Knowing the main compliance regulations and how they apply to the cloud.

### Resources to study:
- Specific cloud security courses: Udemy and LinkedIn Learning have courses on cloud security and regulatory compliance. A course like "Cloud Security Fundamentals" can be useful.
- Security certifications: Courses like the AWS Certified Security â€“ Specialty or Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) can help you deepen your knowledge of cloud security.
- Compliance reading: Read about regulations like GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA on the official sites of cloud platforms.
