#Regional Computing
-Regional Computing refers to the strategic deployment of cloud provider infrastructure in specific geographic locations to enhance connectivity, reduce latency, and optimize performance for users in that region. 
-These regional data centers ensure faster response times and compliance with local regulations.

#Cloud Scalability
-Cloud Scalability refers to the ability of cloud environments to dynamically adjust resources based on demand. 
-In AWS, services like AWS Lambda enable automatic scaling by provisioning different virtual machines (VMs) or compute resources depending on the number of users interacting with the application simultaneously. 
-This ensures optimal performance and cost efficiency.
